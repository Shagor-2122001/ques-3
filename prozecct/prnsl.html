            <h2>Become a web Developer</h2>
            <p>Web Developers are responsible for creating websites that are both functionally and aesthetically pleasing to the user. The typical work activities of a Web Developer include back-end tasks such as developing databases, writing and testing code for website functions, troubleshooting code in existing features and brainstorming new features based on user feedback. Their work activities also include front-end tasks like choosing color palettes, font pairings, and making other aesthetic-based decisions.</p>

                <p>As a front-end web developer, you’re in a good spot if you’re looking for a new job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that web developer jobs will grow 8% between 2019 and 2029—much faster than average.
                But while this occupation doesn’t require years of formal education, it is a highly skilled profession. To be a front-end developer, you’ll need core skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Depending on the job, you might also need to know back-end languages like Ruby. Your cover letter and resume should show that you have the skills and experience required to do the job..</p>
